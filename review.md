GPS Visualizer - When you upload your GPS data, GPS Visualizer will automatically detect what kind of file it is and process it accordingly. The output can be in the form of Google Maps, KML files for Google Earth, JPEG maps, SVG drawings, elevation profiles, plain-text tables with all your raw data, or GPX files that can be used with many other GPS-related applications. Moreover, all of the maps and profiles can be adjusted in innumerable ways using the options on the input forms: you can change the size, the colors, the background map, etc. In the case of Google Maps, there is even more you can do to edit your map after it's been created, if you're comfortable with HTML and/or JavaScript.

csGPS and NMEA Visualizer - Visualize your NMEA log files with NMEA Visualizer. Use your GPS with csGPS by importing map from OpenStreetMap, also edit those map, and synchronize them.

VisualGPS - If you own an NMEA-capable GPS receiver, there are a substantial number of programs available for free that can monitor and display NMEA data. VisualGPS,  in addition to several commonly-found functions, it has one potentially very useful function that I haven’t found in any other similar program. Note: A version of VisualGPS with similar functionality is also available for Windows CE/Mobile devices.

After you’ve installed the Visual GPS program, started it up, and configured it to connect to your NMEA COM port (perhaps the one defined by XPort, described in yesterday’s post), you’ll have access to five function panels from the toolbar:
Command Monitor Window – Displays the NMEA text strings as they come in. You have the option of saving this data as it arrives to a text file.
Signal Quality – Displays the signal strength of the GPS satellites acquired by the receiver, and whether the almanac data has been received – gray for no, solid blue for yes. For WAAS satellites, like #48 below, there is no almanac, so the signal bar is always gray.
Azimuth And Elevation Window – Shows the position of the GPS satellites above the horizon.
Navigation Window – Shows latitude, longitude and altitude; if you’re in motion, also shows speed and distance traveled:
Survey Window – This is the most interesting and unique function. It will gather position data, and plot it in the top map window so that you can observe how the measured GPS position changes with time. Positions are plotted as small blue “x”es:
